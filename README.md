# YTMusicDownloader
This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using tkinter to download audio from YouTube videos as MP3 files using the yt_dlp library.

The script provides a user-friendly GUI for downloading YouTube videos as MP3 files. Users enter a YouTube URL, optionally specify an output directory, and click "Download MP3" to save the audio. The app shows progress, handles errors, and ensures the GUI remains responsive by using threading. It relies on ffmpeg.exe for audio conversion, which must be included when bundled as an executable.

Still on going. create an EXE for this but too large to upload.
